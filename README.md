# Zillow-Web-Scraping-Project

This project was created to efficiently compile data into a single document. Using a Web Scraping API to connect to the Zillow.com website. I extracted rental property data in an area of personal interest and converted the data into a single, readable CVS file. The project can be found on my GitHub Portfolio page.
